h1. The Literally Sexy, Sexy Password Field

"Color hashing":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/visual-hashing/ the password field is nice, but then it's a little difficult to remember the color. What was the color of my password on gmail again? "Purple yellow"?

This is an alternative:

<div style="overflow:hidden; border:1px solid #ccc; padding:5px 20px 20px 20px; " >
<div style="float:left; margin-top:25px;margin-right:10px;">Type Password: </div>
<input id="pass" type="password" style="float:left;margin-top:20px; width:200px; height:30px;font-size:16px;"/>
<div id="girl" style="float:left; margin-left:20px;"></div>
 <div id="copy" style="float:left; width:200px; margin-left:20px; margin-top:25px; text-decoration:underline;">Copy To Clipboard</div>
</div>

<div style="display:none"><img src="/images/sexy.png" /></div>

*Passwords always hash to same dancing step so you know you have typed the right password.*

Now, isn't that more easy remember guys? If this were implemented on twitter my password would make her bend over. What would she do on your twitter, gmail and facebook? Leave a comment.
