Backspace Hell
==============

I don’t have a problem with my typing. In fact I type really fast. I’ve
one small problem however. When I type a line and notice a mistake in
the beginning of the line, I backspace until I get to the error, then
fix it and type the rest again. I can’t seem to get out this habit. May
be because backspace involves less movement of fingers than reaching the
arrow buttons or mouse.
