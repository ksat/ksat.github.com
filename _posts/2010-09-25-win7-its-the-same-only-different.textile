h1. Its the same.. only different

Upgraded to windows 7 some time back. Whenever you do upgrade to a new operating system, the new user interface gives you a high.

The win 7 UI, is pretty neat especially considering that I am moving from XP.. Until I open one of the inner dialogs. like “Internet options”. Those just look the same! except a translucent title bar.  I feel cheated.  :(. Oh wait, there are other things apart from UI, I should see before I declare that.  or Should I?
